FSUIPC Autopilot feedback control facility
==========================================

FOR PROGRAMMERS!

Offsets 0700 - 0717 = Pitch control by elevator and/or elevator trim
Offsets 0718 - 072f = Bank control by aileron
Offsets 0730 - 0747 = KIAS/GS control by throttle(s)
Offsets 0748 - 075F = Mach control by throttle(s)

The latter two are mutually exclusive -- if both are enabled only KIAS
operates, the other is switched off.

Each of these blocks of 24 bytes are used as follows:
 

0-7        Double target pitch or bank, in degrees, speed in knots or Mach


8          Switch to enable the control loop.

This is 0 for "off", non-zero for "on".

 
9            Flags:

2^0 = 1     No trim-out. This is only applicable to pitch control,

By default FSUIPC will control the pitch using the elevator, but then, when
very close (less divergence than your original minimum), it will trim out
the elevator divergence. This is more or less what a pilot would do and seems
to be the way the real aircraft work too, as far as we've determined. 

However, if you do not want this transfer of offset to the trim, set this
flag.

2^1 = 1     Trim only: again, this is only applicable to pitch control.

Normally FSUIPC will control the pitch by elevator adjustments. If this flag
is set it will use the trim only.

Note that the flags are independent -- even if the trim is used for control,
any user-set or remaining deviation on the elevator can also be trimmed out
when the pitch is closely achieved.

2^2 = 1     Speed and Mach control only: use EPR for engine limits instead
of N1% (see below).

2^3 = 1	    Speed control only: use ground speed, not indicated air speed


10-19    Factors used in the feedback loop calculations.
These are 5 16-bit values, as follows:
 
     10-11 value L
             = unsigned low difference, in
             degrees/knots/machhundredths * 256
            128 == 0.5 degrees default for pitch and bank
            51 == 0.2 knots for speed
            10 == 0.0004 mach (.04 1/100ths)
     12-13 value H
            = unsigned high difference,
            in degrees/knots/machhundredths * 256
            2560 == 10.0 degrees default for pitch and bank
            7680 == 30 knots for speed
            1792 == 0.07 mach ( 7 1/100ths)
     14-15 value R
            = signed max rate of change to attempt,
            in degrees/knots/machhundredths * 256 per sec
            307 == 1.2 degrees per sec default for pitch and bank
            589 == 2.3 knots per sec default for speed
            256 == 0.01 mach per sec (1 1/100th)
                     (The sign allows reversal if needed)
     16-17 value Fh
            = signed high fiddle factor, scalar * 256
            25600 = 100 default for pitch and bank
            7600 = 29.7 default for speed and mach
     17-18 value Fl
            = signed low fiddle factor, scalar * 256
            12800 = 50 default for pitch and bank
            3600 = 14.8 default for speed and mach


Note that you can change these at any time, but the change does not become
effective until you next enable the feedback control after it has been turned
off (and seen to be turned off). This is because FSUIPC builds a lookup table
from these values, it doesn't use them directly.

New values will also be applied after FS has been paused, put into slew mode,
or entered menus or modal dialogues. This is because all the feedback
operations are suspended during these times (to prevent absurd runaway
changes) and this is effectively achieved in the same way as you turning the
operations off and on again.

20-21     Parameter 1:
22-23     Parameter 2

The use of these depends on the control:

For pitch and bank, Parameter 1 is the maximum change to the FS control in any
one "tick". Default is 512 (out of the range of -16383 to +16383 provided by
the control). The pitch and bank loops operate at FS's tick rate of 18/sec
(approx), so this limits the change to 9216/sec.

For pitch only, parameter 2 is the amount of trim to transfer per tick when
"trimming out", unless this is prohibited by the option flag 2^0. By default
this is 32 -- i.e. 576 per second. This will help applications in achieving
realistic trim wheel movements -- I suspect there's a limit to how fast they
really spin. Certainly the PFC motorised trim wheel will be regulated (but I
don't know its speed yet).

For speed and mach control, Parameter 1 gives the maximum engine setting and
Parameter 2 gives the minimum. This, by default, is the N1% value, in exactly
the same units as provided by FSUIPC (e.g. offset 0898 for Engine 1). For
props this will relate to the RPM of course. The defaults are 90% (value
14745) and 20% (3276) respectively.

If you want the limits in terms of EPR, set the flag 2^2 and replace these
limits by ones in the same units as the FSUIPC supplied EPR (e.g. offset 08BC
for engine 1). Note that FS does not provide EPR for props nor for all jets.

FSUIPC controls each engine separately within the same limits, but using the
same throttle changes for each, calculated in the same way. It only operates
throttles for engines which exist and which are flagged as "combusting"
(e.g. FSUIPC offset 0894 for Engine 1).

Note that changes to the target, the switch, the flags, and Parameters 1
and 2, can be made at any time and are effective immediately, unlike the
factors themselves. The feedback loop is roughly 18 times per second for
all controls.

The actual target rates are calculated from the difference in target value and
current value, using rates of change, and using the variables detailed above.

The pitch and bank system seems to work quite well. There are frequent little
trim changes, but maybe these are realistic (time to watch some cockpit videos
I think! <G>).

The speed control needs tuning for most aircraft, especially the Mach one. The
"fiddle factors" are just my "guesses" and need refining. The mach minimum and
maximum and the max rate are also my initial guesses.


There are testing facilities, so you can play with those. Just go to the Keys
or Buttons page. You can assign key presses or buttons to the following extra
controls:

Fsuipc bank hold off
Fsuipc bank hold on
Fsuipc bank hold set
Fsuipc bank hold toggle
Fsuipc mach hold off
Fsuipc mach hold on
Fsuipc mach hold set
Fsuipc mach hold toggle
Fsuipc pitch hold off
Fsuipc pitch hold on
Fsuipc pitch hold set
Fsuipc pitch hold toggle
Fsuipc speed hold off
Fsuipc speed hold on
Fsuipc speed hold set
Fsuipc speed hold toggle

These should be self-explanatory. For the "Set" ones, put the value to
be set as the parameter -- only whole numbers, but okay for testing
(degrees, knots, or 100 x mach). For the "on" and "toggle" controls the
current pitch/bank.speed or mach becomes the target to maintain.
